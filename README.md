# QT Chart Web API
The main backend for the QT chart platform. Image manipulation is done through another API.

## Progress
All the initial features work (CRUD + login/logout). Needs some reorganization.

## The Future
- Add tests at the request level.
- GET and DELETE requests need to be reorganized to accept data in the URI rather than the payload.
- Planning to move chart formatting data from the frontend to the API.
- Planning on eventually (V3.0) including a matchmaking service.
